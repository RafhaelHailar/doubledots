Known steps:

1. make the layout of a calculator. This can likely be stolen from template on the web, just find one with a simple template. Use the two lines variant, 1 = state, 2 = input. That is the simplest to make.

2. add reactions to the different buttons.

We need to break the task down in the different steps. We need to explain what happens in the different steps. I think that we should be able to create the calculator now.
