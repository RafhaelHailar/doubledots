Known steps:

1. make the layout of a calculator. This can likely be stolen from template on the web, just find one with a simple template. Use the two lines variant, 1 = state, 2 = input. That is the simplest to make.

2. add reactions to the different buttons.

We need to break the task down in the different steps. We need to explain what happens in the different steps. I think that we should be able to create the calculator now.

### QUESTIONS

A. How would we pass an argument to a function? If an event is similar to another it is common for a function to be derived that needs a variable to assign the function's behaviour. Defining the same funtion multiple times would be bloated. 

B. Can customReactions access the event? Data could be retrieved from attributes rather than variables.

C. What considerations are beeing taken for accessibility of disabled people? Some page readers use semantics to read page parts out loud.

D. How can I add eventlisteners to the window? such as scroll or keypresses.

Currently only click events are defined.
Math.js library is used for evaluations.
