  "content": "Great stuff! Can you give me a demo of the trigger `hover:`. The `hover` uses the customReactions.defineTrigger that takes a similar name input as a reactionRule, but that accepts a class that `extends Attr` with an upgrade(name) method instead of a higher order function.

  ```js
customReactions.defineTrigger('hover', class HoverTrigger extends Attr {
  upgrade(name){
    
  }
});
```

The demo uses the `hover:` trigger to toggle a css class on the element being hovered to alter the mouse pointer to something else.


The purpose of the demo is to illustrate how triggers are made."
