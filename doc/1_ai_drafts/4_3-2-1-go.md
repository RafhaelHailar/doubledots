For a simpler demonstration of a 3-2-1-go countdown using DoubleDots, we'll create a single `div` element that begins with the text "Click me to start". Upon clicking, it will countdown from 3 to 1, followed by displaying "Go!", with a one-second pause between each update. We'll use the specified reaction chain format.

### HTML Setup

First, let's set up the HTML with a `div` element for the countdown.

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>3-2-1-Go Countdown</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="countdown" click:inner_3:sleep_1000:inner_2:sleep_1000:inner_1:sleep_1000:inner_go>Click me to start</div>
</body>
</html>
```

### Adding DoubleDots Custom Reactions

Next, we define the custom reactions for changing the innerText and the `sleep_` reaction for the delay between changes.

```html
<script>
// Define reaction for changing innerText to "3"
customReactions.define('inner_3', function(e) {
    this.ownerElement.innerText = "3";
});

// Define reaction for changing innerText to "2"
customReactions.define('inner_2', function(e) {
    this.ownerElement.innerText = "2";
});

// Define reaction for changing innerText to "1"
customReactions.define('inner_1', function(e) {
    this.ownerElement.innerText = "1";
});

// Define reaction for changing innerText to "Go"
customReactions.define('inner_go', function(e) {
    this.ownerElement.innerText = "Go!";
});

// Custom sleep reaction
customReactions.defineRule('sleep_', function(duration) {
    return async function(e, oi) {
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, duration * 1000)); // Convert seconds to milliseconds
        return oi;
    };
});
</script>
```

This setup uses the `click` event to trigger a sequence of reactions: changing the inner text to "3", waiting for one second, changing to "2", waiting again, and so on until it displays "Go!". The custom `sleep_` reaction is defined to handle the delay, taking the duration as an argument in seconds to align with the reaction chain's specification.

### How It Works

- When the user clicks on the "Click me to start" div, the `click` trigger initiates the reaction chain.
- The `inner_3`, `inner_2`, `inner_1`, and `inner_go` reactions change the div's innerText accordingly.
- Between each text change, the `sleep_1000` reaction pauses the execution for 1 second, providing the countdown effect.

This example demonstrates how DoubleDots can manage both DOM manipulation and timing functions within a cohesive, declarative framework, facilitating complex interactions with simple, readable code.
