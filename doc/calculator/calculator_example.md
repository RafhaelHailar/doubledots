# Example N.1 - Calculator

In this example we implement doubledots on a classic calculator. 

We aproach this by implementing events on the whole table, disserning with the 'event' variable in which button the click was made, later handling each according to their value.

The handling starts with filters, detecting wheter a number was pressed or an operator. Following this, the value or the operation are handled.
