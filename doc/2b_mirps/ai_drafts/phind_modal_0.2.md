Given the detailed explanation of the Doubledots framework and the requirements for creating a modal with two buttons that display different content upon clicking, let's proceed with crafting an example. This example will focus on the HTML structure and the Doubledots framework's event handling mechanism, without delving into extensive styling.

### Step 1: HTML Structure

First, we'll create the basic HTML structure for the modal, including two buttons and a close button. The modal will initially be hidden.

```html
<div id="modal" style="display: none;">
 <div id="modal-content">
    <span id="close-button">&times;</span>
    <p id="modal-text"></p>
    <button id="button1">Button 1</button>
    <button id="button2">Button 2</button>
 </div>
</div>
```

### Step 2: Doubledots Framework Setup

Next, we'll set up the Doubledots framework to handle the modal's functionality. We'll define custom reactions for opening the modal, displaying different content based on the button clicked, and closing the modal.

```html
<script>
 // Define custom reactions
 customReactions.define("openModal", (e, oi) => {
    // Open the modal
    document.getElementById("modal").style.display = "block";
 });

 customReactions.define("displayContent", (e, oi) => {
    // Display content based on the button clicked
    document.getElementById("modal-text").innerText = oi;
 });

 customReactions.define("closeModal", (e, oi) => {
    // Close the modal
    document.getElementById("modal").style.display = "none";
 });
</script>
```

### Step 3: Assigning Events to Elements

Now, we'll assign the Doubledots event handlers to the elements. We'll use the `click` event to trigger the modal opening and the content display, and the `click` event on the close button to close the modal.

```html
<button id="openModalButton" click:openModal>Open Modal</button>

<script>
 // Assign events to buttons inside the modal
 document.getElementById("button1").click = "displayContent:Button 1 content";
 document.getElementById("button2").click = "displayContent:Button 2 content";
 document.getElementById("close-button").click = "closeModal";
</script>
```

### Final Thoughts

This example demonstrates how to create a basic modal using the Doubledots framework, focusing on the event handling mechanism rather than extensive styling. The modal can be opened by clicking a button, and different content is displayed based on which of the two buttons inside the modal is clicked. The modal can be closed by clicking the close button.

Remember, this is a simplified example to demonstrate the concept. In a real-world application, you might want to add more sophisticated styling and additional functionality.
