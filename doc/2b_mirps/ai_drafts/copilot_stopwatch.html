<!-- I want to build a stopwatch app using doubledots:

  The display should have:
    - a start button
    - a stop button
    - a reset button
    - a display of the current time
    - an input field to set the time

  The logic should:
    - start the stopwatch when the start button is clicked
    - stop the stopwatch when the stop button is clicked
    - reset the stopwatch when the reset button is clicked
    - display the current time in the display
    - set the time to the input field value when the start button is clicked

-->
