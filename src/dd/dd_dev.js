//1. DoubleDots doesn't treat objects made using new as primitives.
//You can remove this restriction if you have a 3rd party library that
//use such objects, and these libraries will still work ok.
//But if you make stuff from scratch, 
//stay away from "new String/Number/Boolean()".
//2. DoubleDots MUST access full .composedPath for all events.
//3. Deprecate lots of the native methods
